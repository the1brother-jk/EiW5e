### Ideas and Concerns

Removed Support Gems from Twilight Strand

#### 1st Playtest Questions for Twilight Strand
* Can the Paladin still divine smite (i.e. still have spell slots)? Yes
* Can the Paladin use Lay on Hands? Yes
* Can the Cleric/Paladin use Channel Divinity? Yes, but it does different things.
 * Paladins and Clerics should only receive lvl. 1 'divine' abilities, spell slots, no spells, any martial abilities, no subclass, Channel Divinity, no Turn Undead, and special uses for Channel Divinity.
* Are clerics and paladins  the only ones that can use 'holy' gems? Or do they get bonuses.
* Language of the Templar?
* How are you handling damage resistance?
* Should the starting gems change?
* How long is "too long"?

#### General
* The concept of how the gems work could drastically break the game. 5e limits the upper bounds of damage, but by the time the players return to Wraeclast, they will be able to instantly annihilate the skeletons and other small monsters that they face.
* Ruthless is a poor low level support skill, and won't be used much in the long term. How to improve?
* Could I model Spectral Throw after Frostbolt?
* What non-gem rewards are available?
* How should resistances work?
* How should attack/cast speed work?
* Are Gems by act cumulative, or do they fall off the loot table until Act 6?
* How should stun work?
 * Use a stun skill (i.e. Heavy Strike or Ground Slam)
 * Deal more than 10% of targets health.
 * Each point beyond this threshold goes to the stun DC.
 * Stun skills with either have +# or -%, which will increase damage when calculating stun or reduce the threshold that you need to reach.
* Could I use this? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O7jCjk_v1ht_X9ctCt4tqw9YfwpoY5Sc/view
 
#### Character Creation
* What races are available?
* Should the Karui be a race or a background?

#### Labyrinth
* What are the trials?
* What do the trials give you?
* What does the labyrinth give you?

#### Part 2
* How will the story change?
* How will the gods work?
* How will the bandit choices play out?

#### Gem Use
* Does mana work for a D&D game?
* Is there a better method, that is still fluid?
* How will traps work?
* How should multiple sources of damage increases be added? Added flat damage or added dice.
* Should Ground Slam have damage bonuses (such as strength)?
* What is consecrated ground?
* Gilding is the wrong word. I need distinguishing descriptions for the gems.
* Minions?
* Conversions?

#### Totems
* How will totems work?

#### Stats
* Saving throw DCs: These are currently based on the three stats Str, Int, and Dex. Should these be based on the other primary attributes?
* How about splitting Str/Int/Dex into Str&Con/Int&Wis/Dex&Cha?
 * Str is associated with damage, Con is associated with health, Int with mana, Wis with energy shield, Dex with accuracy or evasion, and Cha with ?
 * How would skill gems be split? Aura & Curse to Wis? What to Con? What to Cha?
