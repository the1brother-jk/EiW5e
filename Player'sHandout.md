### Exiled in Wraeclast

You were offered service to God and to Oriath, and in that service you were shown the true path to greatness. But you have chosen to walk your own path, to follow your selfish desires. That road leads to only one place! By the divine authority of the Templar, you are hereby exiled to the forsaken shores of Wraeclast! Let its waters cleanse you of sin. Let its fires consume your past. Find your redemption, exile, or die in the attempt.

This campaign takes place on the continent of Wraeclast and the island of Oriath. Oriath is an island civilization, with the capital of Theopolis, that was once a part of the Eternal Empire, which once spanned much of Wraeclast. A few hundred years ago, the empire on Wraeclast vanished, and the few travellers who managed a safe return warned of the horrors and the undead that now plague the land. Do to these warnings, and because of the violent and unending storms that now surrounded the continent, travel to Wraeclast ended, and Oriath continued to grow and prosper on its own.

Oriath is a theocratic country and is governed by the Templar, who are lead by the High Templar Dominus. Dominus lives in Theopolis and presides over the Court of Divine Temperance, which has recently established the practice of exiling criminals to Wraeclast. The prosperity of Oriath is due to their mercantile success and to the large number of Karui slaves that they possess.

### Character Options

When creating a character, use your DM's preferred creation method, with the following exceptions:
* The players will start with no items or equipment, just the ragged clothes on their back.
  * This includes spellbooks. A character that requires a spellbook (such as a wizard) will need to find a way to create a new spellbook.
* The Cleric and Paladin will not have access to their spells and divine abilities.
* Karui?
* Other races?
***
You will also need to create the crimes (real or not) that have condemned you to exile.

### Dieties

In Oriath, they do not recognize a pantheon, but only one god. Clerics and Paladins who (at some point were accepted in Oriath society) likely serve this god and were a part of the templar.
