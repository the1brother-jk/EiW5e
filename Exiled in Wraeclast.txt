# Exiled in Wraeclast

You were offered service to God and to Oriath, and in that service you were shown the true path to greatness. But you have chosen to walk your own path, to follow your selfish desires. That road leads to only one place! By the divine authority of the Templar, you are hereby exiled to the forsaken shores of Wraeclast! Let its waters cleanse you of sin. Let its fires consume your past. Find your redemption, exile, or die in the attempt.

## Setting
This campaign takes place on the continent of Wraeclast and the island of Oriath. Oriath is an island civilization, with the capital of Theopolis, that was once a part of the Eternal Empire, which once spanned much of Wraeclast. A few hundred years ago, the empire on Wraeclast vanished, and the few travellers who managed a safe return warned of the horrors and the undead that now plague the land. Due to these warnings, and because of the violent and unending storms that now surrounded the continent, travel to Wraeclast ended, and Oriath continued to grow and prosper on its own.

Oriath is a theocratic country and is governed by the Templar, who are lead by the High Templar Dominus. Dominus lives in Theopolis and presides over the Court of Divine Temperance, which has recently established the practice of exiling criminals to Wraeclast. The prosperity of Oriath is due to their mercantile success and to the large number of Karui slaves that they possess.

## Who are the players?
The players take on the roles of those who have been exiled to Wraeclast. They will need to create a backstory as to why they were exiled to Wraeclast. The DM can write a Letter of Exile for each player, using the following format:

# Virtue Gems
Virtue gems provide powerful abilities to their wielders, allowing them cast spells or modify their attacks. In order to use a skill gem, you must be holding it in your hand, you must be attuned to it, or it must be socketed in a magic item that you are using.

### Using Gems

To use any skill gem, you must first pay the mana requirements. Using an attack skill gem requires an attack, and using a spell skill gem requires an action.

Attack skill gems normally cost mana equal to their tier. Spell skill gems normally cost mana equal to half your proficiency (rounded down) for tier one, and equal to your proficiency for tier two. If you use your action to use a channeling skill, you can use your bonus action to use it again. Spell channeling skills cost PRO/3 or PRO/2 mana (instead of the normal PRO/2 or PRO).

Ex: A level 5 Fighter has a tier 1 Ground Slam, an attack skill gem, a tier 2 Ice Nova, a spell skill gem, and a tier 1 Blight. He could use his action to make two attacks with Ground Slam, each time spending 1 mana (for a total of two mana), or he could use his action to cast Ice Nova by spending 3 mana. He could also use his action and his bonus action to cast blight twice, after spending 2 mana.

Some gems will require the targets to make saving throws. The DCs of these saving throws is determined by the color of the gem. If the gem is blue, the DC is equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier if it is a greater gem. If the gem is red, the DC is equal to 8 + your Strength modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Strength modifier if it is a greater gem. If the gem is green, the DC is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier if it is a greater gem.

When using an active skill gem, you can spend mana to enhance the skill with a support skill gem, as long as the requirements are met. You must either be attuned to the support skill gem or have is socketed in the same item as the active skill gem.

Some spell skill gems require a spell attack. If you are a spellcaster, use your normal spell attack modifier. Otherwise, your spell attack modifier for this skill is equal to your intelligence modifier plus your proficiency modifier.

### Mana

A character has mana equal to their level, plus their proficiency modifier, plus their intelligenc modifier, if it is positive. A level 1 character with 16 Intelligence will have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 mana, and a level 5 character with 4 Intelligence will have (since their intelligence modifier is negative) 5 + 3 = 8 mana.

A character regenerates all their mana after performing a long rest. 

## Ailments

When a creature is hit with an attack or a spell, there is a chance that it will be affected by an ailment. Ailments are persistant conditions that are associated with  different types of damage.

##### Ailments and Damage Types
| Damage Type | Ailment | Base Threshold |
|:----:|:-----:|:-------------|
| Fire  | Ignite | 1 |
| Cold  | Chill | 1 |
| Lightning | Shock | 1 |
| Slashing | Bleeding | 0 |
| Piercing | Bleeding | 0 |
| Bludgeoning | Stun | 0 |
| Radiant | Ignite | 1 |
| Necrotic | Inflict | 1 |

\page

In order to cause an ailment, the threshold must be rolled in an attack or a saving throw. For an attack, the threshold number indicates the range, starting from 20, that you must roll to hit the threshold. For a saving throw, the threshold number indicates the range starting from 1, that you must roll to hit the threshold. A threshold of 0 can not be hit. The threshold can be modified by skills and magic items. If an attack has no threshold of a particular type, it cannot receive modifiers to that threshold.

Ex: Kor makes a spell attack with firestrike, which has an ignite threshold of 3. If he rolls 18-20, he will ignite the target. He also casts Frost Bolt, which has a chill threshold of 4. If a creature hit rolls 1-4 on its saving throw, it becomes chilled.

##### Chill & Frozen

A creature that is chilled has their movement speed halved, cannot take reactions, and cannot attack more than once per turn. When a Chilled creature becomes chilled again, it must make a CON saving throw or be frozen. Chill lasts for 2 rounds.

A creature that is frozen cannot move, speak, or take any actions 1 round, after which, they thaw out and return to a Chilled state with a refreshed duration on the Chill.

##### Ignite

A creature that is ignited burns for 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn. Ignite lasts for 4 rounds.

##### Shock

When attacking a creature that is shocked, you have advantage on your damage rolls. Shock lasts for 2 rounds.

##### Bleeding

A creature that is bleeding takes 2 damage at the end of each of its turns. Moving while bleeding doubles the damage from bleeding. Bleeding lasts until it is healed with any healing spell or if a successful DC 12 Medicine check is made. If a healing spell is used to heal bleeding, you do not gain any health from it.

##### Inflict

A creature that is inflicted takes necrotic damage at the start of its turn equal to 1/4 the combined physical and necrotic damage dealt to it. Inflicted lasts for 2 rounds.

##### Stun

When the Stun Threshold is hit, the creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw or be stunned.

# Prologue

## Twilight Strand
This campaign begins with members of the party aboard a ship sailing through stormy seas. They are criminals, maybe innocent, but with varying severity of crimes, who have been exiled to Wraeclast. They will be brought on deck and lined up, where they will hear the captain reading the letters of exile. After completing a letter, the captain will place the letter on the person. When he has finished all the letters, each prisoner will be pushed overboard.

Each player will make a Constitution saving throw, which will determine in which order they come to consciousness on the shore, with each point translating into 6 sec (1 round) earlier. Upon waking, each character will find themselves washed ashore, where they will see a raging sea behind them, and before filthy grey sand covered with wreckage, rocks, and corpses. Beyond the shore tower rocky crags and cliffs, which extend out into the sea on the left. To the right, in the distance, they can see a light. They will see people walking all along the beach, but on 15+ they will recognize them as zombies. Each player that wakes up will be within 50 ft. of the players that are already away. After the first time a player scavenges, a Drowned, which appears to be a corpse until it moves, will stand up and attack them. If the players delays too long in an area, roll for a wandering monster (table M1). The beach is about 1000 ft. long, and is split into 8 sections, each 125 ft. long. The players will awaken in the first section and it will contain only 1 drowned. Any time the party enters a new section, roll for a full party encounter (table M2). Hillock will be in the last section. Behind him will be palisades surrounding a rocky outcrop, on top of which appears to be the ruins of a stone fortification.

There will be a number of nonplayer exiles dependant on the number of players that will also be washed ashore. These exiles will work with the players, banding together to try to survive the undead, but they will take the brunt of the attacks and will likely die.

##### NPC Exiles
| # of Players | # of NPC Exiles |

After killing the first drowned, the party will find their first skill gem. After 2 encounters, the party will find a chest containing an active skill gem for each player minus one. They should each get a gem that matches a weapon they possess, or one that their character would prefer.

Whenever the party tries to take a short rest, roll on the table below to see if their rest is interrupted. Precautions can be taken to better their odds, at the DMs discretion. The party cannot benefit from a long rest due to current conditions (cold rain, no cover, no dry spot, threat of enemies, etc.).

If another player assists them, they will have advantage on the roll. After this roll, they have broken open all of the crates, turned over all the rocks, and can find nothing else.
