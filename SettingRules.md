# Virtue Gems

Virtue gems provide powerful abilities to their wielders, allowing them cast spells or modify their attacks. In order to use a skill gem, you must be holding it in your hand, you must be attuned to it, or it must be socketed in a magic item that you are using.

## Using Gems

To use any skill gem, you must first pay the mana requirements. Using an attack skill gem requires an attack, and using a spell skill gem requires an action.

Attack skill gems normally cost mana equal to their tier. Spell skill gems normally cost mana equal to half your proficiency (rounded down) for tier one, and equal to your proficiency for tier two. If you use your action to use a channeling skill, you can use your bonus action to use it again. Spell channeling skills cost PRO/3 or PRO/2 mana (instead of the normal PRO/2 or PRO).

**Example:** A level 5 Fighter has a tier 1 Ground Slam, an attack skill gem, a tier 2 Ice Nova, a spell skill gem, and a tier 1 Blight. He could use his action to make two attacks with Ground Slam, each time spending 1 mana (for a total of two mana), or he could use his action to cast Ice Nova by spending 3 mana. He could also use his action and his bonus action to cast blight twice, after spending 2 mana.

Some gems will require the targets to make saving throws. The DCs of these saving throws is determined by the color of the gem. If the gem is blue, the DC is equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier if it is a greater gem. If the gem is red, the DC is equal to 8 + your Strength modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Strength modifier if it is a greater gem. If the gem is green, the DC is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier if it is a lesser gem, or 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier if it is a greater gem.

When using an active skill gem, you can spend mana to enhance the skill with a support skill gem, as long as the requirements are met. You must either be attuned to the support skill gem or have is socketed in the same item as the active skill gem.

Some spell skill gems require a spell attack. If you are a spellcaster, use your normal spell attack modifier. Otherwise, your spell attack modifier for this skill is equal to your intelligence modifier plus your proficiency modifier.

## Mana

A character has mana equal to their level, plus their proficiency modifier, plus their intelligenc modifier, if it is positive. A level 1 character with 16 Intelligence will have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 mana, and a level 5 character with 4 Intelligence will have (since their intelligence modifier is negative) 5 + 3 = 8 mana.

A character regenerates all their mana after performing a long rest.

## Ailments

When a creature is hit with an attack or a spell, there is a chance that it will be affected by an ailment. Ailments are persistant conditions that are associated with  different types of damage.

### Ailments and Damage Types
| Damage Type | Ailment | Base Threshold |
|:----:|:-----:|:-------------|
| Fire  | Ignite | 1 |
| Cold  | Chill | 1 |
| Lightning | Shock | 1 |
| Slashing | Bleeding | 0 |
| Piercing | Bleeding | 0 |
| Bludgeoning | Stun | 0 |
| Radiant | Ignite | 1 |
| Necrotic | Inflict | 1 |

In order to cause an ailment, the threshold must be rolled in an attack or a saving throw. For an attack, the threshold number indicates the range, starting from 20, that you must roll to hit the threshold. For a saving throw, the threshold number indicates the range starting from 1, that you must roll to hit the threshold. A threshold of 0 can not be hit. The threshold can be modified by skills and magic items. If an attack has no threshold of a particular type, it cannot receive modifiers to that threshold.

**Example:** Kor makes a spell attack with firestrike, which has an ignite threshold of 3. If he rolls 18-20, he will ignite the target. He also casts Frost Bolt, which has a chill threshold of 4. If a creature hit rolls 1-4 on its saving throw, it becomes chilled.

### Chill & Frozen

A creature that is chilled has their movement speed halved, cannot take reactions, and cannot attack more than once per turn. When a Chilled creature becomes chilled again, it must make a CON saving throw or be frozen. Chill lasts for 2 rounds.

A creature that is frozen cannot move, speak, or take any actions 1 round, after which, they thaw out and return to a Chilled state with a refreshed duration on the Chill.

### Ignite

A creature that is ignited burns for 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn. Ignite lasts for 4 rounds.

### Shock

When attacking a creature that is shocked, you have advantage on your damage rolls. Shock lasts for 2 rounds.

### Bleeding

A creature that is bleeding takes 2 damage at the end of each of its turns. Moving while bleeding doubles the damage from bleeding. Bleeding lasts until it is healed with any healing spell or if a successful DC 12 Medicine check is made. If a healing spell is used to heal bleeding, you do not gain any health from it.

### Inflict

A creature that is inflicted takes necrotic damage at the start of its turn equal to 1/4 the combined physical and necrotic damage dealt to it. Inflicted lasts for 2 rounds.

### Stun

When the Stun Threshold is hit, the creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw or be stunned.
