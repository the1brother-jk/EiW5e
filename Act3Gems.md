This is a green gem with gold gilding. Ghostly blades swirl within the gem in a mesmerizing pattern.

**Lesser**: When making a melee attack with a dagger, claw, or one-handed sword, you may spend 1 mana to use Blade Flurry. You rapidly strike enemies in a 5-foot cone in front of you, gaining 1 charge (maximum charges equal to your proficiency bonus). This attack requires concentration.

On your turn while channeling, you may:
- Spend 1 mana as an action to make another attack and gain another charge
- Release the skill (no action required) to end the channeling

When you release Blade Flurry or your concentration ends, make one weapon attack against each creature in the cone. This attack deals your weapon damage plus 1d4 damage per charge you had.

**Standard**: When making a melee attack with a dagger, claw, or one-handed sword, you may spend 2 mana to use Blade Flurry. You rapidly strike enemies in a 10-foot cone in front of you, gaining 1 charge (maximum charges equal to your proficiency bonus). This attack requires concentration.

On your turn while channeling, you may:
- Spend 1 mana as an action to make another attack and gain another charge
- Release the skill (no action required) to end the channeling

When you release Blade Flurry or your concentration ends, make one weapon attack against each creature in the cone. This attack deals your weapon damage plus 1d6 damage per charge you had.

**Greater**: When making a melee attack with a dagger, claw, or one-handed sword, you may spend 3 mana to use Blade Flurry. You rapidly strike enemies in a 15-foot cone in front of you, gaining 1 charge (maximum charges equal to your proficiency bonus). This attack requires concentration.
