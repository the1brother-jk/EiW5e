## Twilight Strand
This campaign begins with members of the party aboard a ship sailing through stormy seas. They are criminals, maybe innocent, but with varying severity of crimes, who have been exiled to Wraeclast. They will be brought on deck and lined up, where they will hear the captain reading the letters of exile. After completing a letter, the captain will place the letter on the person. When he has finished all the letters, each prisoner will be pushed overboard.

Each player will make a Constitution saving throw, which will determine in which order they come to consciousness on the shore, with each point translating into 6 sec (1 round) earlier. Upon waking, each character will find themselves washed ashore in section 1, where they will see a raging sea behind them, and before filthy grey sand covered with wreckage, rocks, and corpses. Beyond the shore tower rocky crags and cliffs, which extend out into the sea on the left. To the right, in the distance, they can see a light. They will see people walking all along the beach, but on a 15+ perception check they will recognize them as zombies. Each player that wakes up will be within 50 ft. of the players that are already awake.

The beach is about 1000 ft. long, and is split into 4 sections, each 250 ft. long. The players will awaken in the first section and it will contain only 1 drowned. Any time the party enters a new section, roll for a full party encounter (table M2). Hillock will be in the last section. Behind him will be palisades surrounding a rocky outcrop, on top of which appears to be the ruins of a stone fortification.

There will be a number of nonplayer exiles dependant on the number of players that will also be washed ashore. These exiles will work with the players, banding together to try to survive the undead, but they will take the brunt of the attacks and will likely die.

##### NPC Exiles
| # of Players | # of NPC Exiles |
| :----: | :----|
| 1-2 | 1 |
| 3-4 | 2 |
| 5+ | 3 |

### Random Encounters

Every ten minutes, roll on the table below to see if a monster wanders nearby. Precautions can be taken to better their odds, at the DMs discretion, but reckless behavior (such as making a lot of noise) should worsen their chances. The party cannot benefit from a long rest due to current conditions (cold rain, no cover, no dry spot, threat of enemies, etc.).

##### Random Encounters

### Section 1

Ocean currents and the tide pull a lot of debris from the ocean to this shore, particularly this end. There is an abundance of debris, driftwood, and even some crates that may be of use. A player can spend 5 minutes to scavenge an area to look for equipment. They roll on the table below, adding their investigation modifier for a chance at weapons. If another player assists them, they will have advantage on the roll. After this roll, they have broken open all of the crates, turned over all the rocks, and can find nothing else.

**Note**: If the party wishes to find something unrelated to this list, such as glass bottles or books, allow them to do so, but any items are likely to be damaged.

##### Scavenge
| 1d20 | Loot |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1-4 | You are interrupted by a Drowned. You can scavenge again. |

| 21+ | You find 2 weapons, 1 set of armor, 2 potions of healing, and a mana potion. Roll 2 times on LootA and once on LootB |

Additionally, a player can make a DC 12 investigation check, survival check, or some relavent crafting/profession check to craft a club or greatclub out of some of the driftwood.

After the first time a player scavenges, a Drowned, which appears to be a corpse until it moves, will stand up and attack them.

After killing the first drowned, the party will find their first skill gem. The gem should match a weapon they possess, or one that their character would prefer. If you want to roll for a gem, use table G1.
